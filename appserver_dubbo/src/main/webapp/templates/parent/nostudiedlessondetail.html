						Angie didn't seem to want to work today. We ran over class time even though we started a few minutes early. She was very hesitant and slow to answer. She hid her face from the camera the last half of the class. She often said she couldn't answer questions or just wouldn't answer them. She had trouble with the words snap and snug. On the phonics part she couldn't read the words. She had some difficulty with the ordering of the sentences, but she got part of it right. The listen and act activity, she would not act out the words, but she did circle the pictures. She got most of them right except for teacher and denstist. The Read Aloud, she said she could not read, so I had her repeat after me. She could not read it will be hot, beach, or it will snow. When it came time to answer the questions, she could do the match up just fine and got the questions right. She could not tell me though which weather it was going to be in the beach picture. In the very last picture she accurately described that there was snow and a sunset.
