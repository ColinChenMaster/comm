<p>
Once you have had 3-4 days to review the training materials, you will teach a practicum class with a VIPKID academic staff member as your “student.” The class will take 40-50 minutes and will be composed of 2 parts. The teaching time will be 20-25 minutes in total. Your “student” will give you constructive feedback after each part.
</p>

<p>Our practicums are scheduled <strong>Monday-Sunday from 9am-12pm Beijing time.</strong> </p>

<p>
<strong>
Before your practicum, please also view our New Teacher FAQs video:

<p>
As you were informed in the recruiting stage, your VIPKID contract is not valid until you pass the practicum stage. Please take your first practicum seriously, and be reminded that failure to pass your first or second practicum will result in termination of contract.
