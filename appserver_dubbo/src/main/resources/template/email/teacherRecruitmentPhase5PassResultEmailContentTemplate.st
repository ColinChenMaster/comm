<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ready to Teach + First Month at VIPKID</strong></p>

<p>Hi $teacherName$, </p>
<p>
You are now ready to start teaching VIPKID students! Congratulations!
</p>

<p>
You will be teaching from a different platform than before: our very own teacher portal! 
</p>

<p>
For teachers in North America, Please use <a href="http://t.vipkid.net">t.vipkid.net</a>
</p>

<p>
For teachers in outside of North America, particularly in Asia, please use <a href="http://t.vipkid.net.cn"> t.vipkid.com.cn </a>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Your username is your e-mail address, and your password is the one you entered when you joined VIPKID Teacher Recruiting. We have set it up using the time zone you provided; if your timezone is incorrect or needs to be changed, you can change it in your Teacher Portal. 
</p>

<p>Kindly mark your availability for the whole calendar month in your Teacher Portal schedule. Please keep in mind that you must reserve at least 15 classes (7.5 hours) in the "peak times": <strong style="color:red;">Mon-Fri 6-10PM, Sat-Sun 9-11AM, 6-10PM (Beijing time).</strong> 
</p>

<p>
Every time you finish teaching a class and click "Leave Classroom," a feedback form should pop up for you to fill out. If it doesn't, you can find the form at the bottom left corner of the classroom window (an orange box with the label "Leave Comments").
<strong style="color:orange;">Kindly fill out the feedback form every time you teach a class. </strong> 
</p>

<p><storng>You will also be added to Education’s “For Teachers” folder on Google Drive. There you will find many helpful resources. </strong></p>

<p>
You should have already added our tech support and education department on Skype. Please double check that you have added both of these:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>Education- vipkid.education </li>
<li>Tech Support- vipkid.service </li>
</ul> 

<p> 
You may contact the Fireman during your classes with any logistical or tech issues you're having. <strong>Remember to message the Fireman "I'm ready" or “OK” two minutes before class.</strong>
</p>

<p>
We evaluate all of our new teachers on a regular basis. Please expect feedback throughout the first month of teaching at VIPKID. We also appreciate your feedback, so feel free to send us your thoughts and suggestions. 
</p>
